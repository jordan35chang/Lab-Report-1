Use the following link to access your CSE15L account:
[Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
Once you find your account, reset the password by following the instructions 

## Step 2: VSCode
If not already installed, follow the instructions on the VSCode Website [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to install VSCode.

## Step 3: Remotely Connecting
Since I am using a Mac, git does not need to be installed and instead can move on to opening the terminal in VSCode(View -> Terminal)
After opening the terminal, input the command(not including the $, and replacing zz with the letters of your account):
$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
When using the cs15l account, I was unable to log in even when I input my password

I instead did the normal ucsd email, and after logging in, the terminal should return something similar to this:

After logging in, try running some commands such as "cd ~", "cd", "ls -lat", "ls -a" on the remote computer. Next, try to run the same commands on your computer. Running a command on the remote computer should look similar to this:
